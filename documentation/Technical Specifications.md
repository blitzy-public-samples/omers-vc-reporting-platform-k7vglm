# INFRASTRUCTURE

## DEPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT

The backend platform for storing and retrieving financial reporting metrics will be deployed entirely in the cloud, leveraging Azure's comprehensive suite of services. This cloud-native approach ensures scalability, reliability, and ease of management.

| Environment | Description | Justification |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Production | Azure Cloud | - Aligns with existing Azure infrastructure<br>- Provides robust security features<br>- Offers scalable and managed services |
| Staging | Azure Cloud | - Mirrors production environment for accurate testing<br>- Allows for seamless promotion of changes |
| Development | Azure Cloud | - Ensures consistency across all environments<br>- Facilitates easy integration with CI/CD pipelines |

## CLOUD SERVICES

The following Azure services will be utilized for the backend platform:

| Service | Purpose | Justification |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Azure Database for PostgreSQL | Primary database | - Fully managed PostgreSQL service<br>- Automatic backups and high availability<br>- Scalable performance |
| Azure App Service | Hosting FastAPI application | - Supports Python and FastAPI<br>- Easy scaling and deployment<br>- Built-in load balancing |
| Azure Functions | Data transformation processes | - Serverless compute for background jobs<br>- Cost-effective for periodic tasks<br>- Easy integration with other Azure services |
| Azure Active Directory | Authentication and authorization | - Centralized identity management<br>- Supports OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect<br>- Integrates well with other Azure services |
| Azure Key Vault | Secrets and key management | - Secure storage of API keys and credentials<br>- Centralized management of encryption keys |
| Azure Monitor | Monitoring and logging | - Comprehensive monitoring solution<br>- Application Insights for performance tracking<br>- Log Analytics for centralized logging |
| Azure Blob Storage | Data archiving and backups | - Cost-effective long-term storage<br>- Integrates well with Azure Database for PostgreSQL |

## CONTAINERIZATION

While the current architecture does not strictly require containerization, we will use Docker to containerize the FastAPI application and Azure Functions for consistency and portability across environments.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[FastAPI App] -->|Containerized| B(Docker Container)
    C[Azure Functions] -->|Containerized| D(Docker Container)
    B --> E{Azure Container Registry}
    D --> E
    E --> F[Azure App Service]
    E --> G[Azure Functions]
```

Justification for using Docker:
1. Consistency across development, staging, and production environments
2. Easier management of dependencies
3. Improved scalability and resource utilization
4. Facilitates CI/CD processes

## ORCHESTRATION

For the current scale of the application, we will not implement a full container orchestration solution like Kubernetes. Instead, we will leverage Azure's built-in orchestration capabilities:

1. Azure App Service will handle scaling and management of the FastAPI application containers.
2. Azure Functions will manage the execution and scaling of the data transformation process containers.

If the system's complexity grows significantly in the future, we may consider migrating to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for more advanced orchestration capabilities.

## CI/CD PIPELINE

We will implement a robust CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Developer Push] --> B{Azure DevOps}
    B --> C[Build]
    C --> D[Unit Tests]
    D --> E[Integration Tests]
    E --> F{Quality Gate}
    F -->|Pass| G[Deploy to Staging]
    G --> H[Automated UI Tests]
    H --> I{Manual Approval}
    I -->|Approved| J[Deploy to Production]
    F -->|Fail| K[Notify Developers]
    I -->|Rejected| K
```

Key components of the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Source Control**: Azure Repos (Git) for version control
2. **Build Automation**: Azure Pipelines to build Docker images and run tests
3. **Artifact Repository**: Azure Container Registry to store Docker images
4. **Deployment Automation**: Azure Pipelines for deploying to different environments
5. **Infrastructure as Code**: Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates for defining and versioning infrastructure

Pipeline Stages:

1. **Build**: Compile code and create Docker images
2. **Unit Testing**: Run unit tests within the build process
3. **Integration Testing**: Deploy to a test environment and run integration tests
4. **Quality Gate**: Run code analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube) to ensure code quality
5. **Staging Deployment**: Automatically deploy to the staging environment
6. **UI Testing**: Run automated UI tests against the staging environment
7. **Manual Approval**: Require manual approval for production deployments
8. **Production Deployment**: Deploy approved changes to the production environment

This CI/CD pipeline ensures consistent, reliable, and automated deployments while maintaining high code quality and providing opportunities for manual oversight where necessary.

# APPENDICES

## A. TECHNICAL INFORMATION

### A.1 Database Indexing Strategy

To optimize query performance, the following indexes will be created:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_companies_name ON Companies(name);
CREATE INDEX idx_metrics_input_company_date ON Metrics_Input(company_id, fiscal_reporting_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_quarterly_financials_company_date ON Quarterly_Reporting_Financials(company_id, fiscal_reporting_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_quarterly_metrics_company_date ON Quarterly_Reporting_Metrics(company_id, fiscal_reporting_date);
```

### A.2 API Rate Limiting

To prevent API abuse, rate limiting will be implemented using the following headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1623456789
```

### A.3 Error Response Format

The API will return detailed error messages in a consistent JSON format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_INPUT",
    "message": "The provided input is invalid.",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "total_revenue",
        "issue": "Must be a positive number"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
