# Note: This file is used by Alembic to configure database migrations for the financial reporting metrics system.
# It integrates with the project's database configuration defined in src/database/config.py.
# The script_location points to the migrations directory where all migration scripts are stored.
# Post-write hooks are configured to use Black for formatting migration scripts.
# Logging is configured for root, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic loggers with appropriate levels and handlers.
# The file supports environment-specific settings through the use of src/database/migrations/env.py.

# Important: The actual database URL should be set in the env.py file, not here.
# This ensures that sensitive information is not stored in version control.
# The env.py file should use the database_settings from src/database/config.py to get the correct URL for each environment.
