# This file is intentionally left empty to mark the 'tests' directory as a Python package.
# It allows the test files within this directory to be imported as modules.

# No code is required in this file for it to serve its purpose.
# However, we can add a docstring to provide information about the test package.

"""
This package contains test modules for the backend application.

The tests are organized into subdirectories mirroring the structure of the main application:
- api: Tests for API endpoints
- services: Tests for service layer functions
- models: Tests for database models
- schemas: Tests for Pydantic schemas
- utils: Tests for utility functions

Each test module should use pytest as the testing framework and follow the naming convention
of test_*.py for test files and test_* for test functions.

To run the tests, use the pytest command from the root directory of the project.

For example:
    pytest src/backend/tests

To run tests with coverage:
    pytest --cov=src/backend src/backend/tests

To generate a coverage report:
    pytest --cov=src/backend --cov-report=html src/backend/tests

Make sure to keep the tests up to date with any changes in the main application code.
Always aim for high test coverage and include both positive and negative test cases.

# Note: It's a good practice to keep this file as minimal as possible.
# If you need to add any shared fixtures or configuration for your tests,
# consider using a conftest.py file in this directory instead.

# You can also use this file to add any necessary import statements that
# should be available to all test modules, but be cautious about adding
# too much here to avoid potential circular imports or unnecessary dependencies.

# Example of a useful import that could be added here:
# from src.backend.tests.fixtures import common_fixtures

# However, it's generally better to keep such imports in the specific test files
# or in a conftest.py file to maintain clear dependencies and avoid potential issues.
