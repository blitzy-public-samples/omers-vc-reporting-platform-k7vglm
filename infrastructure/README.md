## Introduction

This infrastructure setup utilizes Terraform to provision and manage Azure cloud resources required for the VC firm's financial reporting metrics backend platform. The infrastructure encompasses essential services such as Azure App Service, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Functions, Azure Key Vault, Azure Storage, and Azure Monitor, ensuring a robust, scalable, and secure environment for the application.

## Prerequisites

Before initiating the infrastructure setup, ensure the following requirements are met:

- Terraform (>= 1.0.0)
- Azure CLI (latest version)
- An active Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- Git (latest version)
- Azure Storage account for Terraform state management (recommended for production setups)

## Directory Structure

The infrastructure code is organized as follows:

```
infrastructure/
├── main.tf                 # Main Terraform configuration file
├── variables.tf            # Variable definitions
├── outputs.tf              # Output definitions
├── providers.tf            # Provider configurations
├── backend.tf              # Terraform backend configuration
├── environments/           # Environment-specific variable files
│   ├── dev.tfvars
│   ├── staging.tfvars
│   └── prod.tfvars
├── modules/                # Reusable Terraform modules
│   ├── app_service/
│   ├── database/

│   ├── key_vault/

│   └── monitoring/
└── scripts/                # Utility scripts for infrastructure management
    ├── init-backend.sh
    └── apply-changes.sh
```

## Getting Started

To set up the infrastructure:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the infrastructure directory:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>/infrastructure
   ```

2. Initialize the Terraform backend (if using remote state):
   ```
   ./scripts/init-backend.sh
   ```

3. Initialize Terraform:
   ```
   terraform init
   ```

4. Select the appropriate environment:
   ```
   terraform workspace select dev  # or staging, or prod
   ```

5. Review and update the environment-specific variables file (e.g., `environments/dev.tfvars`).

6. Plan the infrastructure changes:
   ```
   terraform plan -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars
   ```

7. Apply the infrastructure changes:
   ```
   terraform apply -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars
   ```

## Environment Management

This project supports multiple environments (development, staging, production) using Terraform workspaces and environment-specific variable files:

- Development: `environments/dev.tfvars`
- Staging: `environments/staging.tfvars`
- Production: `environments/prod.tfvars`

To switch between environments, use the `terraform workspace select` command before planning or applying changes.

## Module Overview

The infrastructure is organized into the following modules:

- `app_service`: Configures Azure App Service for hosting the FastAPI application
- `database`: Sets up Azure Database for PostgreSQL with high availability and security features
- `function_app`: Configures Azure Functions for data transformation processes
- `key_vault`: Sets up Azure Key Vault for centralized secrets management
- `storage`: Configures Azure Storage for data archiving, backups, and Terraform state management
- `monitoring`: Sets up Azure Monitor and Application Insights for comprehensive monitoring and logging

Each module is designed to be reusable, configurable, and compliant with best practices for enterprise-grade infrastructure.

## Common Operations

### Updating Infrastructure

To update the infrastructure after making changes:

1. Review and update the relevant `.tf` files or environment-specific `.tfvars` file.
2. Run `terraform plan -var-file=environments/<env>.tfvars` to preview the changes.
3. If the plan looks correct, apply the changes with `terraform apply -var-file=environments/<env>.tfvars`.

### Adding New Resources

To add new resources:

1. Add the resource definition to the appropriate module or create a new module if necessary.
2. Update `main.tf` to use the new module or resource.
3. Add any required variables to `variables.tf` and the environment-specific `.tfvars` files.
4. Add any relevant outputs to `outputs.tf`.
5. Update documentation and comments as necessary.

### Destroying Infrastructure

To destroy the infrastructure (use with extreme caution):

```
terraform destroy -var-file=environments/<env>.tfvars
```

Ensure you have proper backups and approval before destroying any production infrastructure.

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data, including connection strings and API keys, are stored in Azure Key Vault.
- Network security groups and firewall rules are implemented to restrict access to resources.
- Enable Azure AD authentication for all services where applicable.
- Regularly rotate secrets and access keys.
- Implement least privilege access control for all resources.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Azure Monitor is configured to collect and analyze telemetry data from all resources.
- Application Insights is set up for the App Service and Function Apps to monitor application performance.
- Set up alerts for critical metrics and thresholds.
- Implement log analytics for centralized log management and analysis.

## Disaster Recovery

- Configure geo-replication for the PostgreSQL database.
- Set up regular backups for all critical data.
- Implement a disaster recovery plan and regularly test failover procedures.

## Performance Optimization

- Use Azure Front Door for global load balancing and caching.
- Implement auto-scaling for App Service and Function Apps.
- Optimize database queries and indexes.
- Use Azure CDN for static content delivery.

## Compliance and Governance

- Implement Azure Policy to enforce organizational standards and to assess compliance.
- Use Azure Blueprints for repeatable sets of Azure resources that adhere to organizational standards.
- Regularly review and audit access controls and resource configurations.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter authentication issues, ensure you're logged in to Azure CLI with `az login`.
- For state-related issues, check the integrity of the Terraform state in the Azure Storage backend.
- Review the Azure portal for any resource-specific issues or constraints.
- Check Azure Monitor and Application Insights for detailed logs and metrics.

## Contributing

When contributing to the infrastructure code:

1. Create a new branch for your changes.
2. Follow Terraform best practices and maintain consistent formatting (use `terraform fmt`).
3. Update documentation, including this README, as necessary.
4. Ensure all changes are tested in a non-production environment.
5. Submit a pull request for review, including relevant test results and documentation updates.

## Version Control and CI/CD

- All infrastructure code is version controlled using Git.
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment of infrastructure changes.
- Use Terraform Cloud or Azure Storage for remote state management in production environments.

For any questions, issues, or security concerns, please contact the infrastructure team immediately.
